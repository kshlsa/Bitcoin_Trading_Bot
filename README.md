# Bitcoin_Trading_Bot
Machine Learning powered Bot for investment in Bitcoin

# How the code works?
This code works in 3 phases.<br>
In phase 1, code analyses the previous market trends of the bitcoin price.<br>
In phase 2, code predicts the market trends of the bitcoin price.<br>
In phase 3, the code tells the user the correct time to buy, sell or wait for the instruction.<br>

# File-wise explanation:
File named prediction.R preforms the phase1 & phase 2 task and analyses the previous market trends as well as predicts the market trends of the bitcoin price.<br>
File named calculation.R tells whether to buy, sell or wait for the instruction after phase 3.<br>
File named test.R performs the phase 3 and tells the user the correct time to buy, sell or wait for the instruction based upon my Machine Learning Algorithm.<br>
File named email.R emails the result to the user.
